## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  - SDL2
  - SDL Image
  - Either and IDE that supports C++ or a working non-integrated setup.

### Instructions
Clone the project while making sure to have the SDL2 Development libraries in your frameworks. Since this project uses both the base SDL library and SDL Image, both libraries must be downloaded separately from [the SDL website](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php). 

Alternatively, use the command (INSERT COMMAND HERE I FORGOT IT) if for some reason the website downloads do not work.

Since this project was made without the use of an IDE (so far), you will need to manually link/set the libraries in your respective environments.

<b>This project has been soley tested on a Macbook pro and, at this point in time, may not function on devices with a different operating system.</b>

## Running the tests

At this point in time, it is only necessary to compile and debug the project.

 <b> no deployment as of now</b>
